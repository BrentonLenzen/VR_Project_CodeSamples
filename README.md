# VR_Project_CodeSamples
This repository contains sample code from my VR Bullet Hell project. The project is ongoing and the code displayed here is not necessarily representative of a final product. Updates to the progress of this project are posted to my Twitter (https://twitter.com/BrentonLenzen).

This project is being developed for the Oculus Quest 2 in C# with the Unity Engine, using the Oculus Integration SDK and the Photon Unity Networking (PUN) platform.
